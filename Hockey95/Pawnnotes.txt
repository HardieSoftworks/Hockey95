wants to make a movement component
derives compn class from PawnMovement (why?)

then he makes structs for accepting physics forces

he does a phys thread game thread separation

how do collisions work with async phys?

Some problems I found when doing his tutorial:
Async physics thread is LIMITED by game thread. If i set AsyncPhysThread to 60 ticks/s and i drop the game thread to 20 ticks/s, the phys thread now runs at 20 fps. Honestly, this sucks, so what is the point.

maybe i could build it around fps=30 and have determinsitic phys for 30 fps? Try it.

Drawbacks or Failures for different methods in netplay

Stock UE physics
can't easily re-sim when getting data from server. this is a dealbreaker

Jolt
how do i get inputs into the subsystem?
does addForce stack if game framerate is higher than Jolt subsystem?
