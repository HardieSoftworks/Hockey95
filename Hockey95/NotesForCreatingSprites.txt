if horizontally inverting a sprite, be careful to paint the "UV"s properly; If not painted properly (or simply horizontally inverted) then logos and numbers and other details will be also horizontally inverted.

Arms and legs, on the other hand can have red and blue inverted pretty quickly. Select the arm+leg and go to 
Edit>Adjustments>Hue/Saturation.
Select HSV button.
For Blue and Red, select only R ,B, and A and crank H to 180. The arm+leg will change to the "opposite" colour and maintain its "black" level.

Things I have learned. It is easier to have symmetry and just use palette colours when possible. Might not be possible for things like jerseys and socks

ROTATING: This tool is fucking amazing: https://torcado.com/cleanEdge/

TODO: in next version:
-add additional "stripes" to jerseys (in 3's)
	-for instance, top part of arms need another stripe, bottom and top parts of front/back jersey need extra, etc
-consider a middle pixel on front/back.
	pros: helps with numbers!
	cons: sucks for logos! 
		puts thing off-center
-Make sprites in this order: N, NE, E...
