AI has BT and BB
BT is how tasks get chosen
BB stores variable data to help make those decisions

Composites (AKA subtrees)
examples: sequence, selector
Logic for moving to different nodes in a tree

Services allow us to do checks and update BB variables
event Receive activation AI
Store updates variables in BlackBoardKeySelector varaibles in the service (instance editable)
Set value as...
Services can be added to tasks. can help getting the vars needed for the BB and then the task

Tasks are logic that the AI tries to implement
Event Receive Execute AI. when finished, use FinishExecute node with success=true

Decorators perform checks to direct BT flow
